          <h3>00: overview</h3>
          <h4>Context</h4>
          <p>On May 27th, 2019, I boarded a plane and embarked on both my first trip to California and my <strong>first international internship at YouTube in San Bruno.</strong></p>
          <p>During the <strong>14 weeks</strong> of my internship, I worked on the Search and Discovery team, which is part of the main YouTube app. The team works to help users find videos to watch, establishing main drivers for discovering content via the home and search surfaces.</p>

          <h4>Role</h4>
          <p>Despite being an intern, I worked independently while under the guidance and mentorship of my host. Unfortunately, I can’t share the details of what I worked on, but at a high level my two projects had to do with <strong>accelerating user journeys across various surfaces and entry points.</strong></p>
          <p>As the sole designer, <strong>I researched, designed, and prototyped interfaces, created slide decks to present to team leads, and collaborated with multiple stakeholders</strong> (including PM/UXR/Eng) to ensure my designs were high quality, well-informed, and feasible.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="projects">
          <h3>01: projects</h3>

          <h4>Primary Project</h4>
          <p>I spent <strong>~11 weeks</strong> working on my main project; it focused on <strong>organizing complex information and translating technical events into a clear, simple experience</strong> for users to achieve desired content faster. With this project, I achieved the following:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Designed a <strong>high-level framework</strong> to create a scalable methodology for future work in the project area</li>
            <li><strong>Redesigned multiple elements</strong> within the Search surface to solve existing problems and streamline the mobile search experience</li>
            <li><strong>Prototyped and tested a new feature</strong> exploring novel interaction paradigms to better surface desired content for users, after ideating over 25 possible solutions</li>
          </ol>

          <p>My project involved <strong>connecting with multiple teams across Google and YouTube</strong> to better align my designs with their strategic goals, <strong>collaborating with other design teams</strong> who would use the framework, and <strong>working with user researchers</strong> to test my prototypes in both local and international markets.</p>

          <h4>Secondary Project</h4>
          <p>While working on my main project, I was also brought on as the UX designer for an Engineering intern’s project that had to do with <strong>accelerating user journeys through new entry points.</strong> My involvement lasted a total of <strong>~8 weeks</strong>, though I spent only 2 of those focusing on the bulk of the design work. Some highlights from this project include:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Collaborating with an engineer to solve problems</strong> that arose during implementation</li>
            <li>Working within the <strong>constraints of a component system</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Presenting the project to design leads</strong> to receive feedback and signoff</li>
          </ol>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <section id="highlights">
          <h3>02: reflection</h3>

          <h4>Highlights</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Working with user researchers to <strong>test my prototype in both local and international markets</strong>, learning how to coordinate across time zones</li>
            <li>Connecting with multiple teams across the org to <strong>align my project with their strategic goals</strong> and ensure it would support future work</li>
            <li>Successfully communicating an information-dense project to peers, design leads, and the UX director via a <strong>clearly organized presentation with a strong narrative</strong></li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Learning how to <strong>balance breadth and depth</strong> in a project by ideating many <i>(so many!)</i> solutions, but narrowing down by applying them to a variety of use cases and thinking through every detail</li>
            <li>Developing the <strong>confidence in myself to take initiative</strong>, choosing design directions and reaching out to teams independently without waiting for approval from my host</li>
          </ol>
