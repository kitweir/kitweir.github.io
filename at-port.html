          <h3>00: overview</h3>
          <h4>Context + Role</h4>
          <p>This was a 4-week, client-focused project created within a team for a senior-level user experience (UX) design course.</p><p>My specific roles included <strong>user research, persona creation, and content strategy,</strong> as well as <strong>writing copy for all elements of the project</strong> (project proposals, video scripts, UI, slide decks). Throughout the project I performed quality checks on all team deliverables and provided feedback to ensure that we established a high level of polish and effective communication.</p>
          <p><strong>Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Keynote</strong> were the tools I used to bring this project to life.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="challenge">
          <h3>01: challenge</h3>
          <h4>Business Problem: Losing Differentiation</h4>
          <p>While performing a competitive analysis of the cruise industry, I discovered that <strong>Royal Caribbean International is losing their differentiator of ‘innovation’</strong> as other lines follow their lead in constantly adding new features to ships. In order to maintain their competitive advantage, they need to effectively differentiate themselves and create value beyond novelty amenities.</p>

          <figure class="small">
            <img src="img/at-port/competitive-matrix.png" class="proj-quote shadow" alt="a competitive analysis of the leading cruise lines">
            <figcaption>a competitive analysis of leading mass-market cruise lines</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h4>Industry-Wide Opportunity</h4>
          <p>We began researching the cruise industry to find an opportunity to differentiate Royal Caribbean, and identified <strong>improving the on-shore experience</strong> as our opening.</p>
          <p>We discovered that <strong>passengers want to enjoy their time onshore in addition to onboard the ship</strong>; currently, the onshore experience facilitated by mass-market cruise lines consists of guided ‘excursions’ (tours/activities) that guests can purchase. However, <strong>guests who do not partake are left to their own devices—a stark difference from the abundant support and service of the onboard experience.</strong> </p>

          <h4>Key Insight: Easing Guest Anxieties</h4>
          <p>While reading the Skift Global Forum magazine, <strong>I discovered a key insight that focused our project: marketed as idyllic, worry-free escapes, cruises overlook the reality of travel</strong>—it is often stressful and anxiety-inducing.</p>

          <p>By acknowledging and addressing guests’ anxieties involved with exploring onshore, Royal Caribbean can provide <strong>value for guests by reassuring and empowering them in feeling confident to explore.</strong> This also creates value for Royal Caribbean, by <strong>emphasizing their brand value of hospitality and differentiating them from their competitors.</strong></p>

          <h4>Framing the Challenge</h4>
          <p>After establishing the context and design space of our project, <strong>I framed the challenge from the perspective of both our client and our users</strong> (Royal Caribbean Cruises and their guests, respectively).</p>

          <h3>02: process</h3>

          <h4>Research Insights</h4>
          <p>To begin the project, <strong>I conducted both primary (user interviews, surveys) and secondary research</strong> to gain insights into peoples' experiences with exploring onshore during a cruise. </p>
          <p>Our research revealed three key insights. These <strong>validated our assumptions and revealed a major pain point in the experience:</strong> </p>

          <ol class="insights">
            <li>Guests are motivated to explore onshore in order to experience a port's culture, cuisine, and sights.</em></li>

          <li>Guests enjoy the freedom to adventure that independent exploration allows, rather than the structure or regime of guided excursions.</li>

          <li>A major pain point that prevents guests from exploring independently is the fear that they won't get back to the ship on time for departure.</li>
        </ol>

          <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>Identifying a Target Audience</h4>
          <p>From our data, we also constructed three possible personas. We chose to focus on our 'Independent Traveller' as they're <strong>most likely to be unfamiliar with the cruise experience and feel hesitant to explore onshore.</strong></p>

        </figure>

          <h4>Mapping the Journey</h4>
            <p>We mapped out the journey through a cruise to understand the existing holistic experience of exploring onshore, <strong>focusing specifically on the moments of preparation, exploration, and return.</strong></p>

          </figure>

          <h4>Establishing Guiding Principles</h4>
          <p>From our research insights and understanding of the existing experience of exploring onshore, I established the three guiding principles of our solution. These acted as <strong>north stars for decision-making, as well as criteria to evaluate our solution again.</strong></p>

          <ol>
            <li>Lowering cognitive overhead</li>
            <li>Quick glances, not long reads</li>
            <li>Leveraging existing Royal Caribbean resources</li>
        </ol>

          <h3>03: solution</h3>
          <p>While 3 of my teammates were responsible for designing the UI of the prototype, <strong>I played two key roles:</strong></p>

          <p>First, it was my responsibility to write copy for the prototype and <strong>establish a tone that followed Royal Caribbean's existing brand tone while also communicating a sense of reassurance and safety.</strong></p>

          <p>Second, I <strong>performed quality checks on the UI throughout the design process, providing evaluation and feedback for the UI team.</strong> My role as a content strategist and UI evaluator resulted in a key moment in the project wherein we <strong>pivoted and changed the scope of our design.</strong></p>

          <h4>Content Strategy + Pivoting</h4>
          <p>During the development of our solution, I recognized that we had multiple elements to our app extension that felt more like <strong>unecessary features than core flows, resulting on our project feeling bloated and unfocused.</strong></p>

          <figure>
            <img src="img/at-port/prototype-v2.png" class="proj-artefact shadow" alt="prototype v2">
            <figcaption>high fidelity prototype, version 2</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>I suggested a pivot from our existing solution: simplying the extension and <strong>stripping away features, keeping only the most necessary information</strong> for easing a guest's anxiety. This was a difficult decision to make, as it meant we had only 1 week to design a new, high-fidelity prototype, and we'd be losing work we had spent a significant amount of time on. However, we <strong>recognized the value in having a focused solution with a clear value proposition, and decided to make the leap.</strong></p>

          <h4>Dashboard</h4>
          <p>The dashboard acts as a hub of port-relevant information for guests who want to explore onshore. When at a port, a countdown lets guests easily see how long they have left onshore, so they don’t have to worry about keeping track of time. We chose to minimize content on the Dashboard to lower cognitive overhead, showing only the most relevant, port-specific resources for a guest.</p>

          <h3>04: challenges</h3>

          <h4>Advocating for Improved Copy</h4>
          <p>During the prototyping phase, another team member wrote problematic copy about the destination (Cuba); cliché language was used to describe its people and culture, and the copy didn't align with the tone or structure of the rest of our solution.</p>

          <p>I rewrote the copy but encountered resistance when trying to update it, as the team was on a tight deadline. I took the challenge as an opportunity to educate my teammates, and by emphasizing how the change would improve our design alongside the potential criticism we could receive otherwise, was able to convince the team to update the copy.</p>

          <p>Although it was difficult to advocate for the change, I’m glad I did; during final presentations the project performed best in class, with its copy commended by teaching staff. From this challenge, I’ve learned to establish clearer communication within project teams and evaluate a project at key stages before moving forward.</p>
